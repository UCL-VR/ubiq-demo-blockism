## Game Design

### What each class does? i.e. (Red Class vs. Blue Class)
- Only picks its own colour up

### Teaching level to you discover game dynamics
- Book with blueprints in them which tell you how to build the structures
- No time limit
- Noise Cues

### Narrative behind the game e.g. Boss in Factory, Building a tower to escape water etc.
- Boss Factory: Players are tasked with certain designs by the boss
    - Factory is designed as Maze so players have to find blocks
    - Delivery comes in at timed intervals with blocks to find
    - Conveyor belt where a certain number of blocks off
    - Money incentive, taking pieces cost and building blocks awards money
    - Structure mimic furniture (IKEA etc. for inspiration)
    - One person has access to the blueprints/order and has to relay the info back to the team on the order
    - Structures can be built block-by-block
    - Workshop area to add complexity
    - Area to drop order items off, if timer runs out whatever is in the area is what you get scored for
    - 5 orders per level

- Escape the Room: Use objects to escape through a hatch/rising water etc.

### Environments Asthetics
- Room with construction pad in middle
- Conveyor belt on one side
- Blueprint behind a island wall on other side
- Looks like a factory
- Area orders are placed into

### Events based class changes
- Using a book for blueprints - only a certain class can see certain designs
- Changing roles within the group e.g. someone collects design, else build etc.
- Color Blinding Mechanics
